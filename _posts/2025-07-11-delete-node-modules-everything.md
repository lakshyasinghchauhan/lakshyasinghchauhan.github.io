As a JavaScript developer, you've likely collected countless `node_modules` folders over time. These directories can grow massive and are often left behind by forgotten or abandoned projects.

In this post, we’ll walk through how to easily find and delete these folders on Windows using the **Everything** search utility.

## 🤔 Why Delete `node_modules` Folders?

* They take up **huge amounts of disk space**
* Often leftover from projects you no longer use
* Cleaning them improves file system performance
